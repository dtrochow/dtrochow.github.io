    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Alongside my interests in software engineering and electronics some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - **Designing 3D** parts and **3D printing**
      - Cycling, gym, rollerblading
      - Extending automation in my home (*Home Assistant*)
      - Board games
      - Learning **Rust** programming language
      - Electronics projects and
        here is an example of one of my projects, which is *RGB Led Cube 4x4x4* (source code on my Github account). I designed and made it from the scratch.
